# Loki

## Visual Cryptography
Visual cryptography is a cryptographic technique which allows visual information (pictures, text, etc.) to be encrypted in such a way that the decrypted information appears as a visual image. 

## Usage
This program allow the user to generate n shares of an image, only by overlapping all n shares the initial image can be seen.

To create an 5-5 scheme on an input.png image simply use this:
```
python loki.py 5 input.png
```

Use --help for the other settings.
